How to open? 
    1. You should install some modules and open duren.py
        How install modules?
            Open terminal and just paste this commands - 

            1. 'pip install colorama'

            2. 'pip install termcolor'

            3. 'pip install playsound==1.2.2'


    After installations you can open it in VSC (just for now)




    <!-- 1. Just in VSC -
        (recomended because in cmd I have some problems with playsound module and game in cmd not working correct pls run this program in VSC!)-->

    <!-- 2. Output/duren.bat
    IMPORTANT - ! before open you should copy duren.py path and insert it in duren.bat after that its will work ! -->
